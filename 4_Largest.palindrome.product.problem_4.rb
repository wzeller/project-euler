#Largest palindrome product
#Problem 4

#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
#The largest palindrome made from the product 
#of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#This loop checks all products of 3-digit numbers and, if palindromic,
#changes the solution. 

#Returns the answer (906609) in .2 seconds.
