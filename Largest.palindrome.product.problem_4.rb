#Largest palindrome product
#Problem 4

#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
#The largest palindrome made from the product 
#of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#convert number to string and figure out if it is the same backwards

if number.to_s == number.to_s.reverse!
	return true

#add to solutions array.  After this, it puts the highest such number.
